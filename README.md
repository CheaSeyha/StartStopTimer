# ⏱️ Time Tracking Web App

## 📌 Why I Built This App
I built this app to solve a real-life problem I personally faced.

While driving or doing long activities, I often didn’t know how many hours I had spent. Using a phone timer was inconvenient because it must keep running in the background, drains battery, and is easy to forget.

So I created a simple web-based time tracking app that works without relying on a running timer on the user’s device.
